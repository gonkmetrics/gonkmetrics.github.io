Operators:

Prompt Method:

<pre><code class="language-css">var value = prompt("input test value");
console.log(value);
</code></pre>

Additionally, the confirm method may be used for Y/N prompts.

<pre><code class="language-css">var result = confirm("javascript is fun");
var vote = result ? "fun" : "not fun";
</code></pre>

Loops:

Loops from all the regular C-syntax languages are supported in JS. Like if-else, while-do, for loops, which function identically to their counterparts in other programming languages.
