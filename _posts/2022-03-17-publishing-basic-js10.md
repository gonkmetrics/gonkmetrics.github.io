# Bootstrap Typography

Regular typography tags such as *bold*, *em*, and *smaller* can be used with Bootstrap.

The grid is divided into 12 column elements and supports any number of rows. The numbering of the column element determines it's position in the screen, although this depends on the size of inner elements as well.
